When Mercedes Benz shows at the CES 2020 their “Vision AVTR” concept inspired by the movie ‘Avatar’. People did not expect much more from it. This is what the concepts are, just a project about: what could be done in the future thanks to the expression of ideas. They were wrong, the manufacturer has made this vehicle a reality and show what it is like to drive it on the street with its hypnotic design and those practically surreal wheels.

##  New interaction between human, machine and nature


When Mercedes Benz shows at the CES 2020 their “Vision AVTR” concept inspired by the movie ‘Avatar’. People did not expect much more from it. This is what the concepts are, just a project about: what could be done in the future thanks to the expression of ideas. They were wrong, the manufacturer has made this vehicle a reality and show what it is like to drive it on the street with its hypnotic design and those practically surreal wheels.

The concepts usually do not come out of a booth at a technology fair or presentation; however, this has not been the case with the Vision AVTR. This Mercedes-Benz electric car, although it will not mass produced, has a functional version that can be driven. Mercedes launches a video where they make: “the road test” in which, Gorden Wagner, chief design officer of the Vision AVTR imagines the car of the future and it functions.

Following the idea of the film 'Avatar' and Pandora's machines, Mercedes-Benz devised a special flyer. In the videos Wagner explains that the vision behind this car is to create a Machine that is almost a part of the ecosystem. They did not want to create a vehicle; they want something almost like a living organism. This Car looks very Futuristic, because of it proportions. It’s a very efficient looking and bio-design machine. That’s the reason why the design goes very gentil through the wind, has fully recycle and sustainable materials.

On the other hand, Vera smith, director of advance user experience designer stablish that this is a car that has no commands. Instead of this, is a car people interact with. Such as a digital membrane of human. So that the machine looks more like a living organism, just like the human. Rather than human approaching to the machine. With this, Smith explains the car has not really a steering wheel, but rather a kind of joystick on which you place the palm of your hand. As you move your hand from one side to the other the car moves sideways or forward. They describe it as a way to "fuse" the human with the machine.
From the design and its connection with the driver it is also worth highlighting its curious spoilers and the lights it brings. The rear spoilers move as the car advances, brakes or turns to improve its aerodynamics. On the other hand, there are thee lights, blue as could not be otherwise, which flood the car everywhere and even on the wheels. They indicate the emotions that the car expresses.
Finally, Alexander Dang, advance exterior design explains how does the vision of this amazing design began. It was an international completion, in which all the competitors were sit together watching the movie (avatar) and everyone designed their own vision of the car.

Vision AVTR is the result not only of an excellent futuristic car. But also, the result of hard teamwork, which compiles the idea of combining: the fantastic world of avatar and our reality. Ideal which is not only based on a technological invention but also focuses on sustainable development, care of the environment and most importantly: how to create the machine more like a living organism and human-like. The technology of the future.
