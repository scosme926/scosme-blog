##  How an electric car works?


This sustainable mobility alternative gets its energy from rechargeable batteries. These are not only used to power vehicles, but are also used for the operation of windshield wipers and lights.
The batteries are located under the vehicle and sometimes in the trunk, and although they are the same type of batteries that are commonly used to start a gasoline engine, they store the energy that is used to power the vehicle and count with a regulator on the batteries to ensure the amount of energy produced and consumed by the car.
The three main elements of the electric car are: Electric motor, controller and battery. When you start the car, current passes from the battery. The controller takes power from the battery and passes it to the electric motor.

“Variable potentiometers are connected between the throttle and the controller. These potentiometers tell the controller how much power it is supposed to deliver. When the accelerator is released, it delivers 0V and when they are fully depressed, ”says Rinkesh, a contributor to Conserve Energy Future.

The electric motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy that moves the vehicle forward, while the controller acts as the buyer of battery power and provides the necessary power to the motor.
