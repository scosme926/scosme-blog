Concerns about water scarcity are on the rise, companies are looking for more and more sophisticated ways to reduce water consumption. For the founder and CEO of Hydraloop, Arthur Valkieser, the answer was clear: to design a device to purify and reuse household water.

Once its installation is finished, the device is in charge of processing the wastewater in different ways, after being processed the water will pass through an aerobic bioreactor and finally it is disinfected with an ultraviolet treatment.

This process allows to eliminate suspended particles, bacteria, soap and other products. It is worth mentioning that this process is used in water treatment facilities on a much larger scale, therefore it is totally reliable. Once this is finished, the Hydraloop provides us with completely clean water suitable for use in the shower, toilet, washing dishes, clothes or watering plants. But BEWARE! This water is not suitable for consumption, since for this it would be necessary for the water to pass through chemical products.

With Hydraloop you can optimize certain settings and get an idea of ​​how much water you are saving in a mobile app built into the system, but otherwise maintenance is minimal. As Ron Popeil would say, you are supposed to set it up and forget about it.

But how much can you save? The company estimates that a household of four people who shower daily, use the toilet regularly and run a washing machine a day could save up to 75,000 liters of water per year. That's not only good for the environment, but also good for your wallet.

100 of these units are currently in use in Europe and Asia, and he plans to start bringing them to the US this year. At $ 4,000 per unit, Hydraloops aren't exactly cheap, but the water savings you get helps you recoup that initial investment over time. And honestly, with the earth in the condition it is in today, $ 4,000 could be a small price to pay to know that you are helping the environment.
