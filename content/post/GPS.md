The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite navigation system made up of a network of 24 satellites placed in orbit by the United States Department of Defense. GPS was originally intended for military applications, but in the 1980s, the government made the system available for civilian use. GPS works in any weather condition, anywhere in the world, 24 hours a day. There are no subscription fees or setup charges to use GPS.

## WHAT IS A GPS  ?

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite navigation system made up of a network of 24 satellites placed in orbit by the United States Department of Defense. GPS was originally intended for military applications, but in the 1980s, the government made the system available for civilian use. GPS works in any weather condition, anywhere in the world, 24 hours a day. There are no subscription fees or setup charges to use GPS.


#### HOW A GPS WORKS?

GPS satellites circle the earth twice a day in a very precise orbit and transmit the signal information to the earth. GPS receivers take this information and use triangulation to calculate the exact location of the user. Essentially, the GPS receiver compares the time a signal was transmitted by a satellite with the time it was received. The time difference tells the GPS receiver how far away the satellite is. Now, with distance measurements from a few more satellites, the receiver can determine the user's position and display it on the unit's electronic map.

A GPS receiver must be connected to the signal of at least three satellites to calculate a 2D position (latitude and longitude) and the movement of the track. With four or more satellites in view, the receiver can determine the user's 3D position (latitude, longitude, and altitude). Once the user's position has been determined, the GPS unit can calculate other information such as speed, heading, track, travel distance, distance to destination, sunrise and sunset times, and more.

Global Positioning System The 24 satellites that make up the GPS space segment are in orbit around the earth about 12,000 kilometers above us. They move constantly, making two complete orbits in less than 24 hours. These satellites are traveling at speeds of about 7,000 miles per hour.

GPS satellites are powered by solar energy. They have backup batteries on board to keep them working in the event of a solar eclipse, when there is no solar power. The little rocket boosters on each satellite keep them flying on the right track.


#### Curiosities of the GPS world

* The first GPS satellite was launched in 1978.
* In 1994 a complete constellation of 24 satellites was achieved.
* Each satellite is built to last about 10 years. Replacements are constantly being built and put into orbit.
* A GPS satellite weighs approximately 2,000 pounds and is about 17 feet wide with the solar panels extended.
* The transmitter power is only 50 watts or less.
