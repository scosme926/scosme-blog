Augmented Reality (AR) assigns the interaction between virtual environments and the physical world, making it possible for the two to intermingle through a technological device such as webcams, mobile phones (IOS or Android), tablets, among others.
In other words, AR inserts virtual objects into the physical context and displays them to the user using the interface of the real environment with the support of technology. This resource has been revolutionizing the way we deal with our tasks (and even those we assign to machines).

## What is Augmented Reality  ?

Augmented Reality (AR) assigns the interaction between virtual environments and the physical world, making it possible for the two to intermingle through a technological device such as webcams, mobile phones (IOS or Android), tablets, among others.

In other words, AR inserts virtual objects into the physical context and displays them to the user using the interface of the real environment with the support of technology. This resource has been revolutionizing the way we deal with our tasks (and even those we assign to machines).

In this way, we can affirm that Augmented Reality is characterized by:

combine the real and the virtual world;
offer real-time interaction;
adapt to the environment in which it is inserted;
interact with all the physical capacities of the environment (in three dimensions).
Have you noticed that we refer to Virtual Reality as an integral part of Augmented Reality? This is because AR and VR are two different concepts, although commonly confused, and that in many cases work together.

#### How does Augmented Reality work?


The integration between the real (physical) world and the virtual world is the main objective of this technology. Thus, for Augmented Reality to be able to reproduce, 3 fundamental components are needed:

a real object that functions as a reference for the interpretation and creation of the virtual object.
The presence of a device with a camera, such as a mobile phone, to transmit the image of the real object.
A software responsible for interpreting the signal transmitted by the camera.
Through the camera, the real object is transmitted to the software, which receives the image and combines it with 3D projections.

In turn, the projections are introduced into the image and superimposed on the physical environment, reflecting the result of the AR to the user.
