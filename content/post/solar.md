Solar panels are a promising source of energy, solar panels crown the roofs of our homes, solar panels illuminate traffic signs, they even help to maintain power for spacecraft. But how do solar panels work?

##  How do solar panels work?

Simply put, a solar panel works by allowing photons, or particles of light, to strike free electrons from atoms, generating a flow of electricity. Solar panels actually consist of many small units called photovoltaic cells. (Photovoltaic simply means that they convert sunlight into electricity.) Many cells linked together form a solar panel. Each photovoltaic cell is basically a sandwich made up of two slices of semiconductor material, usually silicon, the same material used in microelectronics.


To work, photovoltaic cells need to establish an electric field. Like a magnetic field, which occurs due to opposite poles, an electric field occurs when opposite charges separate. To achieve this, manufacturers "dope" silicon with other materials, giving each slice of the sandwich a positive or negative electrical charge.

Specifically, they seed phosphorus on the top layer of silicon, which adds additional electrons, with a negative charge, to that layer. Meanwhile, the lower layer receives a dose of boron, resulting in fewer electrons, or a positive charge. All of this adds up to an electric field at the junction between the layers of silicon. So when a photon from sunlight hits a free electron, the electric field will push that electron out of the silicon junction.

A couple of other components in the cell convert these electrons into usable energy. Metallic conductive plates on the sides of the cell collect the electrons and transfer them to the wires. At that point, the electrons can flow like any other source of electricity.

Recently, researchers have produced ultra-thin and flexible solar cells that are just 1.3 microns thick, about 1/100 the width of a human hair, and 20 times lighter than a sheet of office paper. In fact, the cells are so light that they can sit on top of a soap bubble, and yet they produce energy as efficiently as glass solar cells, scientists reported in a study published in 2016 in the journal Organic Electronics. Lighter, more flexible solar cells like these could be integrated into architecture, aerospace technology, or even wear electronics.

There are other types of solar power technology - including solar thermal power and concentrated solar power (CSP) - that work differently from photovoltaic solar panels, but take advantage of the energy in sunlight to create electricity or to heat water or air.
