# Robomart Mobile Robotic Food Store


Today we know about a new system that allows the store to bring consumers' homes closer to making purchases, it is the Robomart mobile robotic food store, a vehicle developed by the Robomart company that is presented as the most accessible grocery store of the world and that stands out for availability, ease of use, speed and, of course, comfort.In a way it reminds us of how Amazon Go works, since it is based on an application, the detection of what is acquired through radio frequency identification technology, and the payment through the automatic charge in the associated account. Robomart is a company founded in 2017 by a group of entrepreneurs with extensive experience in the home delivery, retail operations, and autonomous vehicle industries.

It is the evolution of the businesses of yesteryear, where local or provincial vendors, either with a vehicle or a cart, brought the products they sold to the door of the houses, something that stopped being profitable, although the truth is that we can still see some trucks and vans that circulate in towns selling some products, especially in the smaller ones, where there are hardly any stores. The operation of the Robomart vehicle is simple, it is enough to request its service through an app and once it reaches the home, a security code previously obtained with the application is entered so that the doors of this robotic store are unlocked. What is necessary is purchased and the technological system is responsible for identifying the products and the quantity in order to determine the payment to be made and which will be automatically charged to the account.

For now, the Robomart company has partnered with the Stop & Shop grocery chain to carry out a pilot test in Boston next spring. This chain believes that it is a good opportunity to take advantage of technology and make it easier for its customers to make purchases with maximum comfort, bringing the store to their doorstep is something that many consumers will appreciate, since some customers prefer to choose themselves fruits and vegetables, something that cannot be done by ordering the purchase or acquiring the products online.

Autonomous vehicles are controlled from a central Robomart facility, the route and sales made are monitored in order to know in advance which products will need to be replenished. Presumably, a limited number of customers can be served if it is intended that everyone can access the store without missing any product. Another issue to highlight is that in this test the offer will be limited, this is no longer so interesting, but the company says that it is a first step, and that this option may be ideal for those who have reluctance when buying food online.
For now, the test will give the opportunity to check how the proposal works and a comparison will be made with the autonomous delivery service like the one we discussed at the beginning. The company does not rule out that its store can combine the two concepts, the purchase of groceries and the delivery service for those who make online purchases. To get an idea about how it works, we recommend you watch the video below.

No details have been given on the number of vehicles that will participate in the test, the variety of food they will transport, prices, etc., presumably this information will be released when the pilot test starts. On the Robomart page they provide details on the operation of autonomous vehicles and the technology currently employed pending patent, among other things.
