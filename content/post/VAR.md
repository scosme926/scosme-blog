## VAR in Soccer

The main objective of this video referee system is to “eliminate clear errors” from the referees. The precise expression used by the VAR promoters to show the spirit of the new regulation is “minimun interference, maximun benefit”, that is, minimal interference with maximum benefit.

#### The VAR will be applied in four specific cases:

* GOALS: Seeks to help the referee determine if there was any infraction to the regulation that prevents the award of a goal already scored.

* PENALTIES: Helps the referee to avoid or correct mistakes around penalties, either because a penalty has been wrongly awarded or because a clear penalty has not been awarded.

* RED CARDS: Helps the referee to avoid errors around the expulsion of a player, either because he did not send off the deserving of this punishment or because he sent off a player unfairly.

* IDENTITY CONFUSION: Helps to clarify errors in relation to warning or sending off the wrong player.

The VAR system was tested in numerous games in some leagues and recently in important tournaments such as the Copa Libertadores, the Club World Cup and the Confederations Cup. According to FIFA, the results were overwhelming because thanks to this system the level of precision of the referees went from 93% before the VAR (incredible! I thought it was much lower) to 98%.
