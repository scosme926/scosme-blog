WiFi stands for Wireless Fidelity. This term was created by a branding company, and it only became popular in its abbreviated form. Describes a technology for creating wireless local area networks of devices based on the IEEE 802.11 standards, which are maintained by the LAN / MAN Standards Committee of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) LAN / MAN Standards Committee, (IEEE 802).

## What is WiFi and what does WiFi mean?

WiFi stands for Wireless Fidelity. This term was created by a branding company, and it only became popular in its abbreviated form. Describes a technology for creating wireless local area networks of devices based on the IEEE 802.11 standards, which are maintained by the LAN / MAN Standards Committee of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) LAN / MAN Standards Committee, (IEEE 802).

The first version of the IEEE 802.11 standards was released in 1997, but its origin dates back to 1985 and the launch of the ISM band for unlicensed use by the Federal Communications Commission of the United States. Today, multiple revisions of the IEEE 802.11 standards are in use, made possible by backward compatibility with IEEE 802.11 hardware.


#### How does WiFi work?

Like traditional radio transistors, WiFi networks transmit information over the air using radio waves, which are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light.

WiFi radio waves are typically 2.4 gigahertz or 5.8 gigahertz. These two WiFi frequency bands are subdivided into multiple channels, with each channel possibly being shared by many different networks.

When you download a file over a WiFi network, a device known as a wireless router first receives the data from the Internet through its broadband Internet connection and then converts it into radio waves. The wireless router then broadcasts the radio waves to the surrounding area, and the wireless device that initiated the download request captures and decodes them.

Because WiFi relies on radio waves, WiFi networks can be disrupted by interference caused by other WiFi networks or various electronic devices, including microwave ovens, cordless phones, refrigerators, televisions, transistor radios, or Bluetooth devices.

To ensure optimal WiFi performance, network administrators often rely on WiFi analyzers such as NetSpot to view, manage, and troubleshoot WiFi connections.

NetSpot can generate a complete visual map of WiFi networks, highlight areas of signal weakness, and reveal possible causes of interference. In today's age of ubiquitous WiFi networks, a tool like NetSpot is indispensable even when establishing a basic WiFi home network.
