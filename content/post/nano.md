## What is Nanotechnology?

Nanotechnology is a type of technology with applications in various fields and that focuses on nano-scale materials and their properties. Nanotechnology, therefore, works with the nanometer (nm) as the unit of measurement (corresponding to one billionth of a meter).

#### Nanotechnology Applications


Nanotechnology has applications in different fields such as Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Engineering and Mechanics. Development in this area enables the improvement of many products and opens up new possibilities. For example, in the field of security, nanotechnology allows the development of microsensors, which are more effective.

In the industrial field, nanotechnology has three main areas of application. The first corresponds to that of nanomaterials, the second refers to nanointermediaries and the last one is specified in nanoproducts.

#### Nanotechnology examples

One of the areas in which nanotechnology is applied is the area of ​​food.

In food processing there are some examples of nanotechnology such as water purification using nanomembranes, the refining of oil already used through a catalytic nanodevice.

In food packaging, nanoparticles of elements such as silicon dioxide can be incorporated into packaging materials. In this way, the characteristics of these packages improve, such as increased heat resistance.

#### Nanotechnology in Medicine

In the field of Medicine, nanotechnology allows, for example, to carry out more precise and complex molecular diagnoses. In this way, nanotechnology offers the possibility of diagnosing diseases of genetic or infectious origin earlier. In addition, the treatment of many diseases is improved through the use of nanotechnology.

Nanoscale biochips are an example of nanotechnology that has many applications in the field of medical research.

In the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, for example, nanotechnology is proving to be a very useful tool. One of its applications is the creation of nanoparticles that function as drug transporters within the body.
