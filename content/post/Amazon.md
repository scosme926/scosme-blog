#### Amazon plans to use that certification to dispatch fully electronic drones to deliver items to customers.


The e-commerce multinational Amazon received permission from the US government to start delivering packages using drones or unmanned aircraft, a fundamental step for the company's future plans.

The authorization demonstrates "confidence in Amazon's security operations and procedures" to deploy a service that will allow packages to arrive in one day around the world, the company's vice president, David Carbon, told AFP.

In recent times, Amazon has made huge investments in a logistics network that allows it to quickly deliver products purchased by its customers through the Prime Air network by drones.

"We will continue to develop and fine-tune our technology to fully integrate delivery drones into the airspace and will work closely with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other regulators around the world to realize our vision. of deliveries in 30 minutes, "Carbon said.

#### Initially in sparsely populated areas

The FAA approved the plan of the company directed by Jeff Bezos, presented last year, to "deliver packages safely and efficiently to its customers", something that, at least initially, will only occur in areas with low population density. .

Thus, it is not expected that in the coming years American cities will be infested with drones roaming their skies from house to house, but rather that these will focus on rural areas or residential environments on the outskirts of large cities.

In addition, as explained by the company itself in its permit application before the FAA, all packages delivered by this method will weigh 2.27 kilos or less (5 pounds), which significantly reduces the risk that these can pose to passersby. if something fails and they fall in mid-flight.
